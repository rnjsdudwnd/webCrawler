Requirements
Apache-Nutch, MongoDB, and Python with pymongo

Problem for crawling all website on the internet
1. Crawling all websites on the internet is broad, the vagueness is an issue. If I crawl all websites a big server computer, such as google engine, is required.
2. Open Source crawlers such as Nutch, Solr, and Scrapy don't crawl all websites from the internet, but only specific websites. 
3. You give Nutch the websites in seed files. I cannot manipulate the files that seed.txt is connected to because it is too advanced for me. So, I cannot make it crawl a whole website. 
4. Trillions of datas canâ€™t be stored in my slow laptop with MongoDB.
